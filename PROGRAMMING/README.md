My personal sugestion is to master JAVA or C++ than any other languages.. 
If you need to choose an additional language go wtih C than python. 
Since most of the Snippets are from C.
I too know python has a wide range of application than above but for an entry level level job they expect you to be familiar with JAVA than any other languges..
Be strong in DSA and OOPS concepts..

You can show you python and javascript skills through your project works
