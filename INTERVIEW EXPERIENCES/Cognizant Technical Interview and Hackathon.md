# Cognizant Technical Interview and Hackathon Experience  

## Overview  
The technical aspect of the interview process was divided into two parts:  
1. **Hackathon Round**  
2. **In-Person Technical Interview**  

This document covers the technical aspects of the process, excluding the aptitude, reasoning, and coding rounds.
