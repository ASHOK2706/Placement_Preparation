# TCS Prime Interview Experience

The interview process at TCS Prime was majorly based on my **resume** and the topics I mentioned during my **self-introduction**. 

The interview duration was around **45 minutes**, and the questions varied depending on the panel. The majority of the questions were **HR-based**, but there were also some **technical** questions.

## Technical Questions:
1. **What is API?**
2. **Java vs C++**
3. **What is pure OOP?**
4. **Access Specifiers**
5. **SQL queries**:
   - How to fetch **first 5 records** using `LIMIT`.
   - How to fetch **last 5 records** using `LIMIT`.
6. **Code in C**: Write a program to **reverse a string**.

## HR Questions:
1. **Who is the CEO and Founder of TCS?**
2. **Product-based vs Service-based companies** – Your preference.
3. **Team vs Group** – Explain the difference.
4. **Why TCS?**
5. **Hard work or Smart work** – Which do you prefer?

## Tips for HR Questions:
- Always back your answers with **examples**.
- For **situational questions**, provide **instances** where you faced the situation.
- If you're from a hardware background (e.g., CSE students with hardware), be prepared to answer **why you chose a different domain** (such as software) over your field of study.
