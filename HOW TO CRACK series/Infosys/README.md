My experience about Infosys (system engineer trainee role)
Most importantly infosys needs java as for their recruitment for the system engineer role 
For the first process that is the  aptitude 

You need to do all the pseudocode correct and there is also sectional cutt off like 65 is the one for each section and there is verbal parts like choosing the correct one for the sentence, error correction,essay, comprehension etc and also 
 graph based questions  and essay plays a major role as hr will ask you about what context you have written that for me they gave global warming and for my friend happiest moment in your life (only these two were asked for my whole clg  were  divided into  two batches )
For HR round 
It mostly depends on the Hr who is questioning you as for me  he asked technical(for some of my friends they asked to write code )and for me they did not asked coding he asked some topics for (like they asked me what is java datatypes and what is stack and queue  , polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction,(explain these with example )and some which I don't remember) most importantly prepare for java ,DBMS , SQL and Nosql (like basic )and most importantly he asked me to explain the project in brief and asked what is your role in the project and what are the things you have implemented and also make sure to put the project in the resume which you know ðŸ’¯ sure good about it  for other people Hr asked technically (like they will ask how will u connect the java to your database) also they asked questions from SQL for some and asked about Nosql for some and for SQL they are telling to write the clauses like join ,inner join outer join ,full join ) all these mentioned will need to written  in paper they will give you a a4 paper

All the best to all writing infosys....
